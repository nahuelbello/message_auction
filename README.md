# Message Auction

Message Auction is a crazy, community-driven dApp where your message gets the spotlight on a live banner as long as you can outbid the current top bid! Every new bid not only displays your message, but it also earns you a share of the rewards that accumulate as more bids come in.

## What It Does

- **Bid with a Message:** Place a bid along with a short message (up to 50 characters) that you want displayed.
- **Live Banner Updates:** The highest bid’s message appears on the banner in real time.
- **Earn Shares & Rewards:** Every bid gives you “shares,” which determine your portion of future rewards.
- **Early Bird Bonuses:** The first 10 bidders get a bonus—1.5× for the first 5 and 1.25× for the next 5.
- **Transparent Fees:** A 4% fee from every bid helps fund the project.

## How It Works

1. **Place a Bid:** Enter your message and the amount of ETH you’re bidding. Your bid must be at least 0.01 ETH higher than the current top bid.
2. **Claim Your Bonus:** If you’re among the first 10 bidders, you receive extra shares to boost your potential rewards.
3. **Watch Your Message Shine:** When your bid is the highest, your message is displayed on the banner.
4. **Earn Rewards:** As new bids come in, a portion of the bid amount is distributed among all participants based on their shares.
5. **Withdraw Earnings:** Once you accumulate rewards, you can withdraw them directly from the contract.
