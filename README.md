# Message Auction

Message Auction is a crazy, community-driven dApp where your message gets the spotlight on a live banner as long as you can outbid the current top bid! Every new bid not only displays your message, but it also earns you a share of the rewards that accumulate as more bids come in.

## How it works

When you visit the website, the first thing you're going to see is the message displayed on the banner along with the current highest bid. That message was placed by the most recent (and highest) bidder. If you want to display your own message on the banner, you need to outbid the current bid by at least 0.01 ETH, and then your message will remain on the banner until someone outbids you.

This is one aspect of the project: you can place any message you want such as advertising, jokes, or anything else. On the other hand, every time you place a bid, that amount of ETH is distributed proportionally among the people who participated in the auction before, based on how many shares they own.

Basically, you receive shares proportional to the amount of your bid, and based on these shares, you receive a portion of future bids. You can find all the instructions on the website.
